### 2) YourShop :  &nbsp; :arrow_up::heavy_check_mark:
   *  Allow to choose the better architeture, as there isn't a binded up framework with it
   *  Is under development
   *  I pretend add microservices architecture and  maybe a message queue
   *  Will be open to use and share your changes if you wanna, as every open source project
   *  Soon, will be added DDD in the remaining parts, improved tests with better manners to take data, for example by adding parameterized tests
